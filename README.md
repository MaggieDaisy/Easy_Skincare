# 1. Project purpose and introduction

This project was created to demonstrate the acquisition of broader coding skills as part of the Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer Course. Technologies used during the application development process are mainly: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django with an additional framework such as Bootstrap. This project aims to create a full-stack e-commerce application that will allow the user to view an asortment, make a secure purchase, leave a comment, store personal data, and get e-consultation.

[**View the live project here**](https://hdhdhddahdyfgsjsklslslsllsls.herokuapp.com/)

Easy Skincare is a full-stack application that allows users to interact on the page. The purpose of this app is to demonstrate and search for skincare products, add rewievs, contact for consultation. This app can benefit skincare enthusiasts who like to experiment with products with clear INCI lists and are recommended by dermatologists. The website offers the possibility to users to store their data, add review and make a purchase. This website is designed in such a way that the user can check it at any time, on the phone on the road, or at home on the computer. The project may be expanded in the future with other, more detailed cetegories.

- Clean User Experience by using technologies mentioned in the introduction - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Django
- Easy and intuitive navigation via the navbar with a dropdown categories of products and services, and toggle button for mobile version
- Informative content builds to give a clean and modern impression of the purpose of the website

### **Structure**


The structure of the application is based on meeting the first needs of the potential user. The website is simple structured, learnable, and intuitive, the first interaction enables the quick and easy finding of information and orientation between features and theme. The text content is short and consistent and the imagery is simple and clean, both describe the purpose and aim very well. All sections allow the user to interact with the site using built-in functions.

All users of the website should be able to see the navigation bar, with clickable options, clear and modern content, and a footer with SM icons. The visual impression and design should be also consistent across all pages of the app.
- **Navigation Bar** on the top of the page which is consistent  - contains names of each site page for browsing easily between them, site logo which acts as a link to the main page, toggle button visible on smaller devices, and icon matching the theme
- **Home Page** - contains a short introduction, hero image, shop button

I have decided on a mix of colors and shades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, The home page was rebuilt several times until met my expectation in a compromising way. There is a lot to improve later in the future.


# 3. Features

> Existing Features

Existing features on the site were created for making the User's Experience easy and intuitive. Application is clear to understand, as a first visible is the purpose of the website which is reading, shopping, storing data, and sharing reviews with others. Space created for users is very simple and comfortable, all features are clearly specified and pointing users to take further steps. The navigation bar and footer are consistent and act as a present component on every page which makes navigation smooth. Name of separate pages acts as active links and brings users to different parts of content and experiences. 

- **Top Navigation Bar**


- **Home Page**
  

- **About Page**


- **Register Page**
  

- **Login Page**
  

- **Profile Page**
  

- **Log Out**


- **Footer**
  - Contains Social Media icons that act as links for Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube and bring the user to the main platforms. In the future should bring the user to real social media provided by the community. Links open in a new tab so that the user can smoothly navigate back to the application.

# 5. Testing

The final result of this project is a full-stack, front-end and back-end web application based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility, and functionality. 
**This is an interactive front-end and back-end web application developed and implemented by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, with additional Materialize and jQuery elements**, so required testing was conducted based on functionality for getting and storing data, visual effects, website layout, and interactive actions which user can take during navigation.

# 8. Deployment

Steps of setting up and creating this project
This project uses recommended for students Code Institute's template with the master branch. 

> The first step to take was 

to create a new repository in GitHub named Easy_Skincare. This project was edited and developed using the IDE GitPod and version control software Git to add, commit and push the code to GitHub where it was stored. 

> The second step was 

Install Django and all necessary adds ,,,,,,,,,,, tbc
